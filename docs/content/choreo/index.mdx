# Choreograph Distributed Protocols

Choreo provides a structured foundation for writing distributed protocol
specifications in [Quint](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint). Instead of
starting with a blank file, you get a paved path with pre-built abstractions for
message passing, state management, and common distributed systems patterns, all
implementing the best techniques for modeling this type of system.

## Why use Choreo

When specifying distributed protocols in Quint, the same problems appear:
- How to represent message passing more efficiently?
- How to distinguish local state from global environment?
- How to represent timeouts?

Experience and research have led us to some answers:
- The [message soup technique](https://quint-lang.org/posts/soup) is the most
  efficient way of modeling exchange of messages
- Functions with proper interface help isolate local state manipulation and
  effects on the global environment without mixing them up and accidentally
  reading from global state.
- Timeouts are simply internal events that can be consumed at any point in the
  future

We learned this and this helps us write good specs. Choreo hands these
techniques to you with a structured way to write specs.

Compare a [traditional Tendermint
specification](https://github.com/informalsystems/quint/blob/main/examples/cosmos/tendermint/Tendermint.qnt)
with its [Choreo
version](https://github.com/informalsystems/choreo/blob/main/examples/tendermint/tendermint.qnt) -
the Choreo version focuses on protocol logic only, letting the framework handles
the distributed systems mechanics in the best way we know.

## How Choreo looks like

Choreo provides ready-made abstractions that protocol designers can import and
use immediately:

```quint
import choreo(processes = NODES) as choreo from "./choreo"
```

### Built-in Message Handling
Instead of manually managing message routing and filtering, define listeners
that automatically trigger on relevant messages:

```quint
pure def listen_proposal_in_propose(ctx: LocalContext): Set[ProposeMsg] = {
  // Filter for relevant proposals
}

pure def broadcast_prevote_for_proposal(ctx: LocalContext, p: ProposeMsg): Transition = {
  // React to proposal
}

pure def main_listener(ctx: LocalContext): Set[Transition] = {
  Set(
    choreo::cue(ctx, listen_proposal_in_propose, broadcast_prevote_for_proposal),
    // other listeners
  )
}
```

### Structured State Transitions

This is what a `Transition` looks like:
```quint
{
  post_state: { ...s, stage: PreVoteStage },
  effects: Set(choreo::Broadcast(PreVote(message)))
}
```

Choreo ships some built-in effects like `choreo::Broadcast` which are handled
automatically. You can define custom effects and provide a function on how to
handle them as well.

### Environment Abstraction

The framework separates protocol logic from environmental concerns like network
delays, message loss, and Byzantine behavior - letting you focus on the protocol
correctness.
