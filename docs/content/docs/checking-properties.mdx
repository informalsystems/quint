# Checking Properties

The main way to interact with a Quint model is by checking properties. The [simulator](./simulator) can be used to increase the confidence on a property, and [model checkers](./model-checkers) can be used to formally verify them. Properties can also be used to query the model and understand it better, finding interesting scenarios.

## Actual properties

Thinking about a system's properties is not an easy task, but can often be useful to increase understanding in many ways. Writing those properties in Quint enables using the tools (simulator or model checkers) to check that property, or to find out where it doesn't hold and adjust the model or the expectations about it.

A system might have safety and/or liveness properties.
- Safety: something *bad* never happens
  - Examples: balances should never be negative, two different wallets may never hold the same NFT, honest consensus parties may never agree on different values.
- Liveness: something *good* eventually happens
  - Examples: eventually all parties decide on a value, eventually termination is detected, eventually a system stabilizes.

It is much easier to write and check safety properties, which can be written as invariants. Liveness properties require temporal formulas, which often rely on assumptions about fairness to be useful, and that may require some hours of study time if you are not familiar already. Also, there are other, more practical, ways to convince ourselves that good things are happening (see below). Safety properties go a long way, start with those. Writing a safety property is as simple as writing a boolean expression:

```quint
val no_negatives = ADDRESSES.forall(addr => balances.get(addr) >= 0)
```

`balances` in this expression (considering the model from the [Getting Started](./getting-started) guide) is a state variable. While checking `no_negatives` as an invariant, Quint's tools will check this expression on every state, meaning it will evaluate it for different values of `balances` and expect it to always be true. It needs to be true in the initial state and in every possible state that comes from it - it cannot *vary*, as it is an *invariant*.

## Non-properties to find interesting scenarios

While invariants are things that need to hold on **every** state, sometimes we want to check that something is true in **some** state - a sort of sanity check. For that, we define witness properties.

  Quint's built-in support for witness properties is under design. Expect more features in the near future.
</Callout>

There are currently two ways to define and check witness properties:
1. Through the `--witnesses` flag of the simulator
2. Through an invariant (`--invariant`) of the simulator (or the model checker, but you probably won't need it)

### Counting interesting traces with `--witnesses`
For (1), you define something that you want to be possible:

```quint
val alice_more_than_bob = balances.get("alice") > balances.get("bob")
```

The example above states that it should be possible for Alice to have more balance than Bob. This for sure won't be true for every possible state, but it needs to hold for some of them.

Let's ask the simulator to check this witness:
```sh
quint run gettingStarted.qnt --witnesses=alice_more_than_bob --max-steps=5
```

Quint reports:
```ansi
[32m[ok][39m No violation found [90m(599ms).[39m
[90mYou may increase --max-samples and --max-steps.[39m
[90mUse --verbosity to produce more (or less) output.[39m
[32mWitnesses:[39m
[33malice_more_than_bob[39m was witnessed in [32m7094[39m trace(s) out of 10000 explored [90m(70.94%)[39m
[90mUse --seed=0x1c8a2137939c73 to reproduce.[39m
```

And that informs us that, in most executions, there is a state where Alice has a larger balance than that of Bob.

<Callout>
  This is a way to find that "good things are happening" without a liveness property. It is not the same as a liveness property, but it's a practical alternative that is enough in many scenarios. 
</Callout>

### Inspecting interesting traces with `--invariant`

If we concretely want to see the trace witnessing our property, we can negate that property (add a `not` in front of it) and ask the simulator to check that as an invariant. This is like asking the simulator "is the property false in all states?" to which it may reply "no! Here's a scenario in where it is true".

```sh
quint run gettingStarted.qnt --invariant="not(alice_more_than_bob)" --max-steps=5
```

Quint reports:
```ansi

[[1mState 1[22m] { balances[90m:[39m [32mMap[39m([32m"alice"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m9[39m, [32m"bob"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m, [32m"charlie"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m) }

```

Although it says "Invariant violated", this is exactly what we wanted: an example where Alice has more balance than Bob.

### Using multiple invariants with `--invariants`

If you want to check multiple invariants at once and determine which ones are violated, you can use the `--invariants` option:

```sh
quint run bank.qnt --invariants no_negatives accounts_match total_positive
```

Quint will check all three invariants and report which specific ones are violated:

```ansi
[90mAn example execution:[39m
[90m[39m
[[1mState 0[22m] { balances[90m:[39m [32mMap[39m([32m"alice"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m, [32m"bob"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m, [32m"charlie"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m) }

[[1mState 1[22m] { balances[90m:[39m [32mMap[39m([32m"alice"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m-63[39m, [32m"bob"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m, [32m"charlie"[39m[90m ->[39m [33m0[39m) }

[31m[violation][39m Found an issue [90m(44ms).[39m
[31m  ❌ no_negatives[39m
[31m  ❌ total_positive[39m
[90mUse --verbosity=3 to show executions.[39m
[90mUse --seed=0x4e85b3a53f7ef to reproduce.[39m
error: Invariant violated
```

This makes it easier to identify which specific properties are being violated when you have multiple invariants to check.

The `--invariants` option also works with the `verify` command, allowing you to check multiple invariants with formal verification:

```sh
quint verify bank.qnt --invariants no_negatives accounts_match total_positive
```

## Inductive Invariants

An inductive invariant is a special, more powerful kind of invariant.
They are a powerful design artifact as they capture the core of why a system is correct. Moreover, inductive invariants enable complete verification without exhaustive state exploration.

### How Ordinary Invariants Work

Model checking of ordinary (non-inductive) invariants follows a straightforward but potentially expensive approach:

1. Check the invariant holds in all initial states
2. Use the step action and a search strategy (breadth-first, depth-first, etc.) to systematically explore all states reachable from the initial states
3. Verify the invariant holds in every discovered state

This process may require analyzing arbitrarily long execution sequences. As explained in our [Model Checkers](/docs/model-checkers) documentation, checking ordinary invariants forces you to choose between:

- **Symbolic bounded model checking** (Apalache) - Solves constraints representing executions up to a given length, providing incomplete verification results
- **Explicit-state model checking** (TLC) - Enumerates all possible states and transitions, which can become computationally intractable for large systems

### The Inductive Approach

Inductive invariants use a fundamentally different verification strategy. Instead of verifying an invariant on all reachable states by exploring them explicitly, the approach relies on a stronger inductive invariant to prove the goal invariant. The verification process consists of three steps:

1. **Base case**: Verify the inductive invariant holds in all initial states
2. **Inductive step**: Prove that if the inductive invariant holds in some state A, then after applying any step transition, the resulting state A' also satisfies the inductive invariant
3. **Implication**: Show that the inductive invariant logically implies the goal invariant

The key insight is that in step 2, state A is not constructed by applying transitions from initial states. Instead, A is any arbitrary state satisfying the inductive invariant's constraints. Through mathematical induction on steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that the inductive invariant holds on all reachable states without explicitly constructing those states.

### Trade-offs and Challenges

While inductive invariants may avoid the state explosion problem, they introduce their own complexities:
- Finding the right inductive invariant requires expertise and creative insight. Unlike model checking where you simply specify properties to verify, you must construct the strengthened invariant yourself, typically through an iterative process of trial and refinement.
- To prove your desired property, you typically need to prove something stronger (the inductive invariant), which can feel counterintuitive. The invariant that makes the proof work may require non-obvious insights about the system.

### When Inductive Invariants Excel

Inductive invariants become particularly powerful when:

- Enumerating all reachable states would be computationally prohibitive
- The inductive invariant's constraints are well-suited to Apalache's symbolic reasoning capabilities
- The system has complex state spaces that resist explicit enumeration

This approach can provide complete verification results even for systems where traditional model checking approaches fail due to state explosion or infinite behaviors.


### Checking Inductive Invariants

An inductive invariant `ind_inv` can be checked with:

```sh
quint verify file.qnt --inductive-invariant ind_inv 
```

To also check if `ind_inv` implies an ordinary invariant `inv`, run:

```sh
quint verify file.qnt --inductive-invariant ind_inv --invariant inv
```

Simulation (`quint run`) does not support inductive invariants.

### How it works

Quint will call Apalache 2-3 times (depending on whether an ordinary invariant was provided):
1. To check if the inductive invariant holds in all possible initial states (base case). This is the equivalent of calling:
  ```sh
  quint verify file.qnt --invariant ind_inv --max-steps 0
  ```
2. To check if, starting from any state where the inductive invariant holds, taking any step results in a state where the invariant still holds. This is the equivalent of calling:
  ```sh
  quint verify file.qnt --init ind_inv --invariant ind_inv --max-steps 1
  ```
  PS: you'd get an error here as `ind_inv` is not an action, and therefore can't be used as `--init`. Using `--inductive-invariant` takes care of this for you.
3. To check if, in any state where the inductive invariant holds, the ordinary invariant also holds. This is the equivalent of calling:
  ```sh
  quint verify file.qnt --init ind_inv --invariant inv --max-steps 0
  ```
