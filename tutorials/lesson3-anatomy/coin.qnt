/**
 * Coin contract from the Solidity examples [1]. It is a nice starting
 * example for Solidity. It is a nice starting example for Quint too.
 *
 * This contract introduces a custom coin. Although Solidity contracts
 * may easily call other contracts, our protocol specification is
 * not easily composable with other protocol specifications. It is possible to
 * make it composable, but it would introduce additional code (following simple
 * idioms), which we want to avoid in this introductory example.
 *
 * As we focus on the protocol idea (in Quint), not the implementation (in Solidity),
 * we omit events and error codes.
