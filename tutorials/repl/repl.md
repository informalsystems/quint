A [REPL][] is a read-eval-print loop. A REPL is usually a good way to start
learning a language.

Most likely, you have seen a REPL before. If you had not, here is a simple
state machine that describes how it works from the user's point of view:

## 1. Installation

You have to install `quint` first. See [README](../quint/README.md).

## 2. Running REPL

Simply run the following command in the terminal:

```sh
$ quint
```

You will see the following output:

```sh
Quint REPL vN.N.N
Type ".exit" to exit, or ".help" for more information
>>>
```

You can type `.help` and then press `<ENTER>` for supported REPL commands.

## 3. Preloading definitions

In this tutorial, we are interactively constructing the module
[kettle.qnt](./kettle.qnt). You can load this file in the [VSCode Plugin][] and
read it, if you would like to have a better overview of the module that we are
constructing. You can also load this file into REPL, if you only want to
evaluate expressions without copying the definitions by hand:

```sh
$ quint -r kettle.qnt::kettle
```

When you load `kettle.qnt` this way, REPL prints `true` indicating that the
module has been loaded successfully:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
true

```

If you check the source of this markdown file, then you will see that it is
written by following the principles of [Literate programming][], using the tool
[lmt][]. As a result, all definitions and the REPL session of this tutorial are
automatically extracted from this file and checked with continuous integration.
This approach may be useful to you, if you are writing your own protocol
specifications in Markdown and like to connect it to Quint specifications.

## 4. Evaluating expressions

The core interaction with a REPL is to enter an expression and get back the
result of its evaluation. Like this:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> 1 + 3
4
```

Or like this:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> Set(1, 2, 3).map(i => i * 2)
Set(2, 4, 6)
```

## 5. Writing definitions

In this tutorial, we are interactively constructing the module
[kettle.qnt](./kettle.qnt) that has the following structure:

```bluespec ./repl/kettle.qnt +=
// -*- mode: Bluespec; -*-
// The example from the REPL tutorial
module kettle {
<<<definitions>>>
}
```

We do not introduce this module in REPL, as REPL internally introduces an
implicit module.

Whenever we write four leading spaces `    ` instead of `>>> ` and `... `, we
append the contents to the file [kettle.qnt](./kettle.qnt). For example:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // an example of a definition
    val isThisMyFirstDefinition = true
```

*Do not forget to copy the definitions in REPL, if you want to reproduce
the full REPL session without loading `kettle.qnt`.*

## 4. Introducing values and definitions

Typing everything in a single expression can become tedious very quickly. To
avoid that, you can introduce top-level definitions, which will be saved in the
REPL context. For instance:

Let's declare two immutable values:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // a constant value that always returns 100
    val boilingTemperature = 100

    // a constant value that always returns 0
    val freezingTemperature = 0

```

And we'll also define an operation to derive temperature in fahrenheit given a
temperature in Celsius:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit
    def fahrenheit(celsius) = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32

```

We can use the values and definitions in later expressions and declarations:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> fahrenheit(freezingTemperature)
32
>>> fahrenheit(boilingTemperature)
212
>>> 0.to(100).exists(celsius => fahrenheit(celsius) == celsius)
false
>>> (-100).to(100).exists(celsius => fahrenheit(celsius) == celsius)
true
```

We can also write new definitions by referring to the previously defined
operators:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // the low range of a thermometer (fixed)
    val veryCold = fahrenheit(-40)

    // the high range of a thermometer (fixed)
    val veryHot = fahrenheit(40)

```

This is how REPL evaluates the expressions that use the above definitions:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> veryCold
-40
>>> veryHot
104
```

**Hint.** At some point, you may want to copy & paste the above output back in
REPL.  Try it. REPL is smart enough to recycle its own output. Be careful
though about not mixing the lines starting with `'>>> '` or `'... '` (which
decorate your input in REPL) with other lines (which indicate the REPL output).
If you do mix REPL input with REPL output, you may get syntax errors.

## 5. Describing a state machine

In its basic form, REPL allows us to evaluate expressions, which make it a
great tool for learning the language. But REPL can do more for you: It can
simulate a state machine. In this section, we interactively specify a model of
an electric kettle:

![An electric kettle](../img/kettle-drawing.png)

Informally, we can describe the most basic operation of a kettle like the one
above with the following [state machine][]:

![State chart](../img/kettle-state1.svg)

If you think, "this diagram is not very realistic", you are right. We will extend
it later.


### 5.1. Introducing state variables

In addition to definitions and values, we also declare state variables:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // the current temperature in the kettle
    var temperature: int

    // is the kettle currently heating?
    var heatingOn: bool

    // is the kettle currently beeping?
    var beeping: bool

```

By default, a state variable is not assigned any value and a reference to
a declared but unassigned state variable will produce a runtime error:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> temperature
runtime error: error: Variable temperature is not set
    var temperature: int
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

<undefined value>
```

### 5.2. Initializing state variables

Undefined state variables are not very useful. Hence, we have to introduce an
action to initialize the state machine and move it forward. For instance, here
is how we initialize our kettle:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // a state initializer
    action init = all {
      temperature' = 20,
      heatingOn' = false,
      beeping' = false,
    }

```

The action `init` is just an action definition, which can be applied later. To
apply it, we simply type `init`:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> init
true
```

Note that REPL has evaluated this action to `true`. It means that the action
has taken place. If it was evaluated to `false`, it would mean that something
prevented the action from being applied; more on that later.

Now we can check that `init` has indeed initialized the state variables as
expected:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> temperature
20
>>> heatingOn
false
```

To make it easier to see how our state evolves, let's also declare a value that
collects all of our state variables in a single record:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // a handy definition that captures the state in a record
    val kettleState = {
      heatingOn: heatingOn,
      beeping: beeping,
      temperature: temperature
    }

```

If we evaluate `kettleState` in the current state, we should get the following
output:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: false, heatingOn: false, temperature: 20 }
```

### 5.3. Updating state variables with actions

Similar to how we introduced `init`, we introduce the action `pressButton`,
which turns on the heating element of our kettle.

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // turn on the heating element
    action pressButton = all {
      not(heatingOn),
      heatingOn' = true,
      beeping' = false,
      temperature' = temperature,
    }

```

Again, we have just defined the action `pressButton`, but that action
is not applied automatically. To apply it, we simply type its name:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> pressButton
true
```

We can check our state variables to make sure that the action indeed took place:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: false, heatingOn: true, temperature: 20 }
```

The heat is on now!

Interestingly, if we try to apply `pressButton` once again, it would not
work, as indicated by the `false` result:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> pressButton
false
```

Indeed, we do not allow the button to be pressed again, if the heating is
already on. In a physical kettle this is usually done mechanically, but in the
abstract world of specs it is up to us, whether we allow for this behavior or
not.

Similar to `pressButton`, we can define the `failover` action that turns off
the kettle when the temperature reaches 100. If the value 100 makes you
puzzled, call `fahrenheit(100)` in REPL ;-)

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // turn off the kettle when the temperature is too high
    action failover = all {
      heatingOn,
      temperature >= 100,
      heatingOn' = false,
      beeping' = true,
      temperature' = temperature,
    }

```

If we apply `failover` to the current state, it will not execute:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> failover
false
```

Indeed, `temperature` is equal to 20 in the current state of REPL:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> temperature
20
```

To properly test `failover`, we should probably define the action `heat`
in our spec. But since we are in REPL, we can also take a shortcut, by
simply setting the state variables to the state we need:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> all { temperature' = 100, heatingOn' = true, beeping' = false }
true
```

This tells the simulator to apply an anonymous action, advancing the state in
the way specified in the expression: It sets `temperature` to 100, `heatingOn` to
`true`, and `beeping` to `false`. (You can double check that by evaluating the
variables.) Note that not only we had to set the value of `temperature`, but
also the values of `heatingOn` and `beeping`. If we had not done that, the
values of `heatingOn` and `beeping` would have become undefined.

Now we can apply `failover`:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> failover
true
>>> heatingOn
false
>>> temperature
100
>>> beeping
true
```

To reset the state to the previous one, we can simply evaluate `init` and
`pressButton` again (there is a better way to do that, which we will show
later):

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> init
true
>>> pressButton
true
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: false, heatingOn: true, temperature: 20 }
```

Now it is time to specify the action `heat`:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // heat up the water by 1C
    action heat = all {
      heatingOn,
      temperature < 100,
      temperature' = temperature + 1,
      heatingOn' = true,
      beeping' = false,
    }

```

By applying `heat` several times, we can see that it heats up the kettle a bit:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> heat
true
>>> temperature
21
>>> heat
true
>>> temperature
22
>>> heat
true
>>> temperature
23
```

### 5.4. Introducing control non-determinism

So far, our specification of a kettle had only one action that turns the
heating element off, namely, the `failover` action. Normally, a kettle can be
turned off without waiting until it boils to 100C. Hence, we add one more
action `depressButton` in our diagram:

![State chart 2](../img/kettle-state2.svg)

This action should be easy to define:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // turn off the heating element
    action depressButton = all {
      heatingOn,
      heatingOn' = false,
      temperature' = temperature,
      beeping' = false,
    }

```

Now we can execute four actions and observe that we managed to heat the kettle
by 1 degree and turn it off:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> init
true
>>> pressButton
true
>>> heat
true
>>> depressButton
true
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: false, heatingOn: false, temperature: 21 }
```

Notice that our specification allows for a new interesting behavior. Evaluate
the following expressions:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> all { heatingOn' = true, temperature' = 100, beeping' = false }
true
>>> depressButton
true
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: false, heatingOn: false, temperature: 100 }
>>> all { heatingOn' = true, temperature' = 100, beeping' = false }
true
>>> failover
true
>>> kettleState
{ beeping: true, heatingOn: false, temperature: 100 }
```

As we can see, both `depressButton` and `failover` can apply when the
temperature reaches 100 and the heating is on. This makes sense in real life. If
the temperature sensor in your kettle has not registered 100 degrees yet, and
you depress the button, the heating element turns off. We do not want to
introduce unnecessary details about precise time measurements and the physical
processes in the kettle, so from our perspective both `failover` and
`depressButton` may happen at the same time.

You can ask the question, whether it makes any difference when `depressButton`
or `failover` are applied. Actually, it does: `failover` sets `beeping` to
`true`, whereas `depressButton` sets `beeping` to `false`. Where did you get a
beeping kettle from, Igor? Well, I bought a "smart" kettle, and nobody told me
that it would beep in the middle of the night, when I would like to make a cup
of tea. It's all good, I bought a "not-so-smart" kettle that is not beeping.

How do we describe in the specification that one of the actions may apply,
whichever happens first, and we do not control which one? Quint has the operator
`any` to do exactly this:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> all { heatingOn' = true, temperature' = 100, beeping' = false }
true
>>> any {
...   depressButton,
...   failover,
... }
... 
true
```

The REPL implementation chooses one of the enabled actions pseudo-randomly.  But
in general, the language does not prescribe one way of choosing between
simultaneously enabled actions. So we prefer saying that Quint evaluates `any {
... }` non-deterministically. To be precise, `any { ... }` describes **control
non-determinism**, that is, it chooses how to continue the flow, but each of our
actions behaves like a deterministic program. We will introduce
[data non-determinism](#dataNondet) in the next section.

Now it is time to define all possible transitions of the kettle in one place:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // one step of the state machine
    action step = any {
      pressButton,
      heat,
      depressButton,
      failover,
    }

```

Having defined `step`, we can conveniently execute steps without specifying
the action that should be executed next:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> init
true
>>> step
true
>>> step
true
>>> step
true
>>> step
true
```

If we print the current state after executing four steps, we will see
that the state is different from the initial one:

<!-- do not save this session in replTest.txt,
     as outputs may differ due to randomness -->

```bluespec
>>> kettleState
{ heatingOn: true, beeping: false, temperature: 21 }
```

**Note:** your REPL session may end up in a different state, due to randomness
of `nondet` in REPL.

**Exercise**. Figure out how REPL ended up in the above state.

At some point, you may want to save particular sequences of actions.
To see how to do it, read about [Runs](#runs).

### 5.5. Introducing data non-determinism

If we look back at how we computed the initial state of our kettle, its
temperature is always set to 20 (Celsius). Most likely, you are using your
kettle under different temperatures too. Let's update the state diagram,
to reflect the reality a bit better:

![State chart 3](../img/kettle-state3.svg)

I never tried to melt ice with an electric kettle, but it should probably work
as expected?

It looks like we have to describe multiple possible initial states that differ
in temperature. This is how we can do that in Quint, specifying that the
temperature should be somewhere in the range of -40 to 40 degrees:

```bluespec "definitions" +=
    // initialize the state machine with non-determinism
    action initNondet = all {
      heatingOn' = false,
      nondet temp = oneOf((-40).to(40))
      temperature' = temp,
      beeping' = false,
    }

```

Let's see how it works. Execute `initNondet` for the first time:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> initNondet
true
```

Here is an example of a state that we may get into:

<!-- do not save this session to replTest.txt, due to randomness -->

```bluespec
>>> kettleState
{ heatingOn: false, beeping: false, temperature: -27 }
```

If we execute `initNondet` more, we obtain different states. Try it:

<!-- do not save this session to replTest.txt, due to randomness -->

```bluespec
>>> initNondet
true
>>> kettleState
{ heatingOn: false, beeping: false, temperature: -40 }
>>> initNondet
true
>>> kettleState
{ heatingOn: false, beeping: false, temperature: 26 }
```

As you can see, `initNondet` does what we wanted: It chooses the initial
temperature from the interval `[-40, 40]` and sets `heatingOn` and
`beeping` to `false`. The magic is done by the special syntax form of Quint
that looks like follows:

```bluespec
    nondet myElem = mySet.oneOf()
    expr
```

REPL randomly picks one of the elements from the set `mySet` and binds the name
`myElem` to the chosen value. The name `myElem` can be used inside the expression
`expr`, which usually contains an assignment. Whereas the Quint simulator used in
the REPL chooses a set element pseudo-randomly, other implementations may
handle non-determinism differently. That is why we say that the `nondet`-form
specifies *data non-determinism*.

## 6. Saving and loading the REPL session

At this point, we have introduced a lot of definitions. It would be great to
save them somewhere, so we do not have to type them again, if we accidentally
close the REPL.

You can save the REPL session with the builtin command `.save`:

```bluespec ./repl/replTest.txt +=
>>> .save kettle.qnt
Session saved to: kettle.qnt

```

This command saves all definitions and evaluated expressions in a file.
You can edit this file in your editor of choice and load it back to REPL:

<!-- don't add this to replTest.txt, as .load prints all values again -->

```bluespec
>>> .clear
>>> .load kettle.qnt
```

Note that if you start with a non-empty session, it's better to clear it with
the command `.clear` before loading the session from the file. Otherwise, REPL
may complain about conflicting definitions. If you want to combine definitions
from several files, you can execute several `.load` commands without `.clear`
between them.

If you tried to save and load your REPL sessions, you might have noticed that
the `.load` command replayed all the expressions you have typed so far.
In the current version, the expressions are saved inside comments, e.g.:

```
/*! (heatingOn, temperature, beeping) !*/
```

So if you do not want REPL to execute the previously typed expressions, you can
just remove them from the file. As a note, the format may change in the future.
