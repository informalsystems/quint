# TNT

TNT is not TLA+. It is a surface syntax for TLA+.

## [Temp] How to run it locally

We use `yalc` to manage unpublished packages. To install it, run

``` sh
npm i yalc -g
```

1. In your `tntc` directory, run `npm run compile` to generate `dist/` and then `yalc publish` to make it available as a local package.
1. In the `vscode/tnt/server`, run `yalc add tntc` and then, under `vscode/tnt`, run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run compile`
1. Whenever you make changes to `tntc`, run `npm run compile` and then `yalc push` to update the distributed contents
1. To use it on your VSCode, copy or link this folder to your VSCode extensions folder:

``` sh
ln -s <full_project_path>/vscode/tnt ~/.vscode/extensions/
```

## Features

## Requirements
