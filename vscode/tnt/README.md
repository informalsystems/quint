# TNT

TNT is not TLA+. It is a surface syntax for TLA+.

## [Temp] How to run it locally

We use `yalc` to manage unpublished packages. To install it, run

``` sh
npm i yalc -g
```

To install the vscode plugin, run the `vscode` make target from [the root of this repo](../../):

``` sh
make vscode
```

## Features

- Syntax Highlighting
- Syntax errors
- Undefined and conflicting names

## Requirements

Since TNT packages are still not on npm, we use `yalc` to locally publish and manage packages

## Known Issues

No known issues yet.
