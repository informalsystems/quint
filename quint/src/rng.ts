 * The interface to a pseudo random number generator. Currently, we are using

 * [1]: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.06278v7.pdf
 *
 * We have tried to use the package 'squares-rng', but it was too hard to make
 * it run with NodeJS and VSCode, as 'squares-rng' is using the ESM modules.
 *
 * [squares-rng]: https://github.com/FlorisSteenkamp/squares-rng
 *
 * Hence, we have implemented the 'squares' function from the paper.  Whereas
 * the squares-rng package is using JS numbers and thus limits the number of
 * produced integers to 2^32, we are using big integers and thus free to
 * produce up to 2^64 integers, as in the original paper. Also, we are using a
 * different key.

 * Our TypeScript implementation of the below C code from the paper [1].
 * We are not using the JS shift operators `<<` and `>>`, which go over
 * conversions to 32-bit integers. Instead, we simply use `/` and `%` over
 * bigint. One has to do measurements, to see what is more efficient.
 * Since the reproducibility and the ability to restore the state is the key
 * for us, and not the performance, this should be fine.
 *
 * This implementation produces up to 2^64 pseudo random unsigned
 * 32-bit integers, in contrast to the squares-rng package, which
 * produces up to 2^32 pseudo random unsigned 32-bit integers.
 *
 * The C code from the paper [1]:
 *
 * ```c
 *  inline static uint32_t squares32(uint64_t ctr, uint64_t key) {
 *  uint64_t x, y, z;
 *  y = x = ctr * key; z = y + key;
 *  x = x*x + y; x = (x>>32) | (x<<32); // round 1
 *  x = x*x + z; x = (x>>32) | (x<<32); // round 2
 *  x = x*x + y; x = (x>>32) | (x<<32); // round 3
 *  return (x*x + z) >> 32; // round 4
