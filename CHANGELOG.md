  produced in a single CLI call (#1365).

### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed

- Fixed a problem where random numbers were internally produced without being
  used. This affects behavior of randomness, and therefore same seeds will
  behave differently before and after this version (#1453).

### Security

## v0.20.0 -- 2024-05-22

### Added

- Added an experimental `--mbt` flag to produce metadata that is useful for
  Model-Based Testing (#1441).
- Added the `allListsUpTo`, a limited but computable version of `allLists` (#1442)

### Changed

  names after compilation, i.e. in Apalache and some simulation errors, and in
  TLA+ produced from the `compile` command (#1444).

### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

## v0.19.4 -- 2024-05-14

### Added
### Changed

### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed

  either Quint's unit type `()` or Apalache's unit type `"U_OF_UNIT"` (#1416).

### Security

## v0.19.0 -- 2024-03-25

### Added

- Added polymorphic type declarations, allowing abstracting commonly used data
  types like `Option[a]` and `Result[err, ok]`. Note that this is not yet
  supported by `verify`. (#1298)
- Added `compile` subcommand, allowing compiling specs to TLA+ (via Apalache)
  and to a JSON format. (#1309, #359)

### Changed

- The latest supported node version is now bounded at <= 20, which covers the
  latest LTS. (#1380)
- Shadowing names are now supported, which means that the same name can be redefined
  in nested scopes. (#1394)
- The canonical unit type is now the empty tuple, `()`, rather than the empty
  record, `{}`. This should only affect invisible things to do with sum type
  constructors. (#1401)

  simulation (#1339)

### Security
